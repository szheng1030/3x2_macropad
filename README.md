# 3x2_macropad

A 3x2 macro pad design in KiCad from while back, syncing here so I don't lose it.  
Fully routed and in theory set for production, would probably consider rerouting in that case though.

Thanks to ai03's wiki: https://wiki.ai03.com/  
The design does use his compilation library for switches too.
